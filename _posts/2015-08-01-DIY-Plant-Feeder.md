### A garden requires patient labor and attention. Plants do not grow merely to satisfy ambitions or to fulfill good intentions. They thrive because someone expended effort on them.

I've documented a small project called "Solar Powered Automated Plant Feeder" for Electronics For You Magazine, Issue Feb,2016. Since now it is made available on their website I can share it here. EFY is a great magazine for Electronics and DIY enthusiasts.

## About Project
I completed this project in a weekend to automatically water my terrace garden plants and Bonsai, oh yes I've a terrace garden :D. The idea is simple , A Soil moisture sensor continuously reads moisture level of soil in pots and once it is below threshold levels the plant is watered by a pump. A pipe mounted on a servo motor is responsible for irrigating pots, the soil moisture levels can be calibrated using values from Internet for type of plant. The servo angle is hardcoded in Arduino SourceCode. Click the link below to read original project article from EFY.
