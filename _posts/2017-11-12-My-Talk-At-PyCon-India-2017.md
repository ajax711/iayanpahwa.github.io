[PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2017/), the premier conference in India on using and developing the Python programming language conducted annual conference in Delhi NCR from 2-5 Nov 2017. It attracts the best Python programmers from across the country and abroad and is the biggest community driven event in the country.

Last year I attended PyCon India and was overwhelmed with everything going on there, keynote talks, regular talks, community bonding, lightning talks and open houses. It was a really fun and knowledgable experience for anyone into opensource and programming. 

This year I decided to submit a talk proposal on Getting Started with Embedded Python using [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) and [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) which are open source projects around Python programming language for embedded system development. The proposal was accepted and I got the opportunity to deliver a talk on same. 

Though, there were a few glitches, I had trouble getting my workstation connecting to the projector but altogether it was a wonderfull experience, I was overwhelmed seeing this many people interested in this topic. Attendees mostly liked the Arc Reactor demo which was built around MicroPython. A few people asked for my talk presentation afterwards, I promised them to share soon, hence sharing the link to my presentation here, which I uploaded on slideshare. Thanks to all who attended and supported, waiting for next year PyCon already! Cheers ;)
