Element14 is a great community for DIY enthusiasts like me, and I've been a part of it since few months now. Element14 regularly organizes Roadtests and design challenge where it challenge community members to submit a related proposal solving problem with a specific kit provided, and so one challenge going on recently is [Enchanted Objects](https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/enchanted-objects) which is an IoT based challenge and I'd submitted proposal named Enchanted Wardrobe for it, which is basically a smart wardrobe which talks to user as he/she open's it and suggest clothes based on current local weathers, I am planning to add some witty interactions as well all using Text to speech APIs.

### Edit 1:
Lucky enough I got selected to compete ahead among top 15 other selected participants and build my proposed project with the kit provided. I am very excited to be selected among top and very intelligent community members like Andy Clark, Jan Cumps and others whom do I also used to know from community and twitter interactions. I can't wait for the kit to arrive. I've got mail fro e14 that it has been dispatched but it usually takes a fortnight to arrive in India.

### Edit 2:
The kit is finally here and I'm loving it already

### Edit 3:
I am making progress on this project and documenting it on my [E14 blog](https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/enchanted-objects/blog/authors/iayanpahwa?ICID=DCH-enchanted-challengers)

The bad part is I am not able to focus on it 100% as my semester exams are going on simultaneously, still trying hard to complete the project. The winner prize is Trip to Maker Faire, USA. Let's see if I can win! But surely it's gonna be fun and thanks to Element14. Toodles!!
