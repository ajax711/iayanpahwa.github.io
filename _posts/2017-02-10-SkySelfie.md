We conducted a workshop on Getting Started with First Person View Drone Racing at JRE group of Institutions, Greater Noida, The very same institute I completed my undergrad from. It was highly demanded by most of my juniors who have seen me flying after my college hours.

Workshop survey can be found on [Github Page](https://github.com/Team-SDIoT/SDIoT_Events/tree/master/Workshops/FPV-Drone-Racing-101/JRE)

It was attended mostly by students, entrepreneur. At the end of workshop we had an Airshow named SkySelfie where each participate stood in a circle and I captured their "SkySelfie" from my Drone ;)
