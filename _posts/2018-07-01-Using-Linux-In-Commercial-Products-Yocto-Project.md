I presented a talk at Indian Linux User Group - Delhi meetup on how to use Linux in commercial products. Along with the attendees we create a Linux powered hypothetical ATM machine, which generally runs on Windows in India :P . It was really fun talking about choosing SoC i.e Brains of your projects, subsystems needed to run the project and the corresponding middleware packages which enable it and help build applications and Human Machine Interface around. Also talked about cross compilers, debugging, maintaining dependencies and lots of other thing. I focused on Yocto project as a Build system to build cusom linux for your product. Slides from the PPT are down below! Cheers...!
